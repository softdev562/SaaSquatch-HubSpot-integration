# SaaSquatch-HubSpot-integration
A project created by volunteer software engineering students at the University of Victoria, in collaboration with SaaSquatch, for importing data from HubSpot into SaaSquatch. This project was created for the course Software Engineering 499 (Design Project II) at the University of Victoria.

You can specify them in the terminal:
